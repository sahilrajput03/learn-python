# The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
# Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of area_of_circle
# Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of circum_of_circle
# Take radius as user input and calculate the area.

radius = input("Enter radius of circle: ")  # assuming input as 3
r = int(radius)
area_of_circle = 3.14 * r**2
print(area_of_circle)  # 28.26


circum_of_circle = 2 * 3.14 * r
