# We learn in this example that we can pass a lambda function after the
#   `for-loop` and condition returned from lambda function will judge whether to
#   show a variable


# Sahil: Probably these ways are helpful in using when we need functionalities
# similar to `find` or `filter` array methods in Javascript.
