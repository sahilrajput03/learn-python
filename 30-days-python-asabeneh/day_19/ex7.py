# TODO: ex7. Write a python application that checks similarity between two texts. It takes a file or a string as a parameter and it will evaluate the similarity of the two texts. For instance check the similarity between the transcripts of Michelle's and Melina's speech. You may need a couple of functions, function to clean the text(clean_text), function to remove support words(remove_support_words) and finally to check the similarity(check_text_similarity). List of stop words are in the data directory
